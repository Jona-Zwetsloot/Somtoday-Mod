Pull requests are welcomed! Be clear about what you've changed, and I'll almost always approve it.

**Before you start, here's a few tips:**
- *If you want to contribute to Somtoday Mod, **you'll need to install the browser extension locally**. Either the Chromium or Firefox version.*
  - To do this, follow the steps described in README.md
- *Only modify one version of the code*
  - So if you're using Firefox, do not modify the Chromium version, and vice-versa
  - The other verisions are automatically generated for you when I run the generation process
- *Do not touch the `// [GENERATION]` comments*
  - These are needed for the automatic code generation for the Android and userscript versions
- *Try to keep the file structure roughly the same*
  - It's not bad if you add files, but reorganizing the whole project is just a pain, since the generation process depends on the current structure
